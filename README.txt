Protos is a simple website that organizes the information of prototyping tools. Other than presenting them all together, users can also use the generator to ask the system about what is the best prototyping they should use for specific kinds of projects. 

There are three sections in Protos: “Which tool”, “All tools”, and “About”.
- “Which tool” contains the generator that can suggest an prototyping tool for the users.
- “All tools” contains all the information about the prototyping tools. On the top of the page, users can search on the tools based on the names.
- “About” page contains simple information of this project.

However, this is only a high-fidelity prototype. To browse through the product, you can follow each step below:
1. Open the index.html;
2. Answer the questions using dropdown menus;
3. Click "Done" to view the result;
4. Go to "All tools" through the navigation on the left;
5. Click the search bar to search the tools by names;
6. Click the filters to check/uncheck the sorting rules;
7. Click the title of each prototyping tool in the list to view the detail;
8. In the detail page, learn about how to use the product by clicking the "download" button on the right;
9. Go to "About" through navigation to view the basic information about the author.
